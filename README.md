## Usage

To start using nim-widgets, you need to include a script tag in the head of your HTML page.

```html
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <script src="tbd"></script>
  <!-- ... -->
</head>
```

Once you have that included, you are ready to use nim-widgets on your page, just include the corresponding tags.
